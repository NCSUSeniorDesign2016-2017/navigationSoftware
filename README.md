## Description
This repository hosts the various files used and modified for the Aircraft Carry-on Internet senior design project at North Carolina State University. Because part of the system functionality requires configuration of the raspberry pi's linux installation, the filestructure here is based off of the root filestructure found in raspbian linux. This should make it easy for a developer to navigate to those files that need to be added or modified by simply logging into the raspberry pi via ssh.
