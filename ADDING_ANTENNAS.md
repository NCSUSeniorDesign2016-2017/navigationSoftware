# Adding Antennas
The provided software has support for up to three antennas, but the big SP8T RF switch can handle 8 antennas. Adding more antennas to the system requires several steps. Defining the GP/IO control pins physically, defining the GP/IO control pins in software, and defining the manual switching, and finally defining the automatic switching.

## 1. Defining the GP/IO control pins physically

## 2. Defining the GP/IO control pins in software

## 3. Defining manual switching

## 4. Defining automatic switching
